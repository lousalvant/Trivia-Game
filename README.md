# Project 5 - *Trivia Game*

Submitted by: **Lou Salvant**

**Trivia Game** is an app that challenges users with trivia questions across various categories and difficulties. Users can select the number of questions, category, difficulty, and set a time limit (30, 60, or 120 seconds). When time runs out, answers are auto-submitted. After completing the game, users can review their score and see which answers were correct or incorrect. They can then return to the options menu to start a new game.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Notes

During development, I faced issues with pushing code to GitHub. The problem was initially due to connection errors when using HTTPS, which I later resolved by switching to SSH. However, further difficulties arose with SSH keys, where my MacBook's SSH key was not recognized. After reconfiguring the SSH settings and verifying the key, I was able to push code successfully.
